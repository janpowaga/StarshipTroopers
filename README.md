# Starship Troopers
Get ready to suit up and join the fight against the arachnid horde in 'Starship Troopers: Lost Squadron'. Will you survive long enough with hordes of bugs coming? Evac is on its way!

## Inspiration
90's shoot'em up and bullet hell games

## What it does
Try to avoid the horde and survive long enough for evac to come and rescue you.

## How we built it
Using python, from the scratch.

## What's next for the Last Squadron
We do not owe right to use Starship Troopers logo or anything, so... It will remain open source and free. :)

**If you play it, try to get to ending screen. It's worth it.**
